  | \* Water amount is an approximation, always. It assumes a medium/fine grind for the whole grain flours. The coarser the grind, the more water you may need. |

  | \*\* Flax seeds absorb a lot of water. Adjust accordingly if you use more of those!                                                                         |

      ### **Step 1: Mixing (10 mins)**


      1. In a measuring jug, weigh your water.

      2. In a separate jug, weigh the starter. Add the Chia seeds and some of the water (eg 1/3, it doesn't matter), mix and let sit for a few minutes while you do the rest (the seeds will soak up the water). It won't look appetizing and that's normal!

      3. In a large bowl, weigh all the other dry ingredients. Mix with a spatula.

      4. Pour your wet mixture into the dry ingredients, as well as most of the rest of the water. Mix with a spatula.

      5. You want a dough that's sticky and shaggy, but not liquidy. Adjust accordingly with any remaining water you didn’t include — even with more if the dough seems too dry. Use your hands if that's easier!

      6. Cover with a lid.

      ### **Step 2: Bulk Ferment (aka time to sleep!)**


      Your bread will now “bulk ferment” - this means the bacteria in the starter will start activating and making your bread rise. Depending on how warm it is where you leave your loaf, and how strong and newly fed your starter is, this could take between 12h-18h.


      In my case, in a kitchen at around 20C with a recently fed starter, it might take around 14h. 


      With a starter that hadn’t been fed in a couple of days, it can be closer to 18h.


      **Note:** During the bulk fermentation, I like to fold my bread once in the bowl. Wet your hands, grab a corner of the dough, and fold it onto the rest of the bread. Do this for all four corners. This gives it a bit of shape, and helps me better gauge when fermentation is over. You can do this at any point during the fermentation -- I like to do it right when I wake up, which is usually a few hours before fermentation is done.


      **Here's a 30 second visual guide on folding.** Your dough will be shaggy and wet so don't worry about it not looking the same!

      ### **Step 3:** Shaping (5 mins)


      Bulk fermentation is over when your bread has risen in size, roughly by three-quarters or so. The dough will look a bit pillowy, and if you press it with your fingers, it will lightly spring up. You might also see some air pockets.


      **It bears repeating:** This is a wet dough, packed with seeds and whole grains. Most of the sourdough videos (including the shaping guides below) out there are for very white beads, and our dough will look nothing like theirs. That's normal so don't despair. This one will taste far more delicious.


      Once happy with the fermentation — and it’s not a perfect science, and sometimes you just have to go ahead with it when it suits you, and that’s fine! — you're ready to shape it. For this:


      1. Spray a mat with water and place your dough onto it, sticky side up. Gently press it into a rectangle.

      2. Wet your hands slightly.

      3. **If you want to make a round loaf:** Fold each corner of the bread onto itself, one by one. Here is a 30 second guide -- note, I recommend using water instead of flour:

         {{ <youtube id="IWA0RAAsBHg" start="8" >}}
      4. ***For a pan / oval loaf, aka batard:*** Fold the top third down and the bottom third up, overlapping slightly, and seal with your fingertips. Roll the dough tightly from top to bottom, creating tension, and pinch the seam to seal. Here's a 30 second guide - again, I'd recommend water and no flour: 

         {{< youtube id="uSwwykPhb_w" >}}
      5. Dust your bread with flour (I like to use rice flour) and place it back inside your bowl, or in a banneton or bread pan lined with parchment paper (for batards). 


      **Why use a banneton?** Bannetons are handy to retain the shape; they’re also useful as they take less space than a mixing bowl. This is especially great if you plan on proofing in the fridge or when making multiple loaves at once.

      ### Step 4: Proofing (2-36h)


      Cover and let your bread proof. You have a few options here, choose the one that suits your schedule best!


      1. **Option 1: Fridge method (aka cold retardation)**. If you can’t stick around, plop it straight in the fridge. It will proof slower, but will still proof. It’s what is known as “cold retardation”. You can leave it there for easily 24h-36h, until you are ready to bake.

      2. **Option 2: Countertop**. Let it proof on the counter for 2-4h, depending on how warm your kitchen is, and how much time you have. If you’re ready to bake your bread, you can heat up your oven in the last 30 mins of proofing and go ahead and bake. 

      3. **Option 3: Do both**. You can also choose to proof your bread on the counter for a few hours, and then stick it in the fridge for up to another 24h.


      Advantages of cold retard: Besides making scheduling easier, (as you can plan exactly when to bake your bread), leaving the dough in the fridge overnight makes it easier to score prior to baking. These doughs are so wet that they're otherwise impossible to score.

      ### **Step 5: Scoring & baking (1.15h)**


      1. Turn your oven to 480F/ 250C. 

      2. Place a Dutch oven or loaf pan (great if it has a cover, like a Pullman pan) in the oven, on the lower middle rack. Let it heat up for 30 mins.

      3. Place a square of parchment paper on one hand, and with the other hand flip over the dough, gently, onto the paper. Dust off excess flour.

      4. Scoring: **These doughs are so wet, that this step is only feasible if the dough has been in the fridge for several hours**. With a scoring blade or sharp knife, make a cut from one end of your loaf to the other, starting with the end away from you. I do a cross shape on round loaves, and one long line on batards. You want to hold the blade at an angle to minimize snagging. Don't go too deep as to not deflate the dough.

      5. Lift the parchment paper with the dough and place it in your Dutch oven / pan. 

      6. Bake for 25 mins with lid. Lower the heat to 220C/ 430F and bake for another 10-12min. 

      7. When it’s done, it should sound hollow if you tap it underneath. It will also have an internal temperature of around 95C (203F).
